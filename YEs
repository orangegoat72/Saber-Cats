  "description": "In the latter half of the 21st century, the Earth Federation Government officially recognized a large amount of bounty hunters as a countermeasure against violent crimes , and the world was full of firearms. One of them, the female bounty hunter "Wildcat Chika," was working in the huntless business as usual, but she returned to the thug D, No. 901, and died. A mysterious man, Sukune, takes artificial respiration and breathes back, but without understanding what the enemy has done, the mysterious man uses a mysterious technique to defeat the thug D 901. I am shocked to see it. After that, Chika is frustrated by Sukune, who follows her failure as a huntless.",
